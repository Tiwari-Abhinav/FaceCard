        # CHANGE THIS LINE:

### 4. Advanced Technique: Provide Multiple "Known" Images

A person's face can look different in various photos (e.g., with/without glasses, different hairstyles). You can significantly improve reliability by providing multiple reference images for each student.

**How to implement this:**

1.  **Change your folder structure.** Instead of one `data` folder, create subfolders for each student:
    ```
    data/
    ├── Amit_Kumar/
    │   ├── amit1.jpg
    │   └── amit2.png
    ├── Priya_Sharma/
    │   └── priya_photo.jpg
    └── ...
